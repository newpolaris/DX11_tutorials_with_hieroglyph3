DirectX 11 tutorials using Hieroglyph3 framework

The objective of this project is to show how to utilize Hieroglyph 3 to make DirectX easier to use. Hieroglyph 3 is a framework that wraps up lots of DirectX functionalities in an object oriented fashion. So that developers do not have to deal with low level details such as windows messaging and COM interfacing with DirectX. However, the documentation for Hieroglyph 3 is scarce. Although it provides many sample projects to show some of the main features, it is not easy to get a good understanding about the underlying system.

This project intends to provide some on Hieroglyph 3 through a series of tutorials that cover most common use cases.
